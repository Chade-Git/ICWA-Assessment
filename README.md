# ICWA-Assessment
Code created for ICWA assessment.

Setup:
1. Open Executable file contained with ICWA Assessment App folder
2. Type commands into command line

NOTE: Commands are case sensitive and are sensitive to white space - for instance, "PLACE 0,0,NORTH" is a valid command, but "PLACE 0, 0, NORTH" would be invalid, since there's added whitespace.
